# Applied Data Science Lab
In this repository, you will find notebooks related to the WQU Applied Data Science Lab lessons. As requested in the institution's code of conduct, these notebooks only show parts of each lab. The skills acquired from each project are addressed in this file.

## Project 1

- Load data into a pandas DataFrame
- Clean and combine messy data
- Examine the relationship between variables using correlation.
- Create insightful visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.

## Project 2

- Load multiple CSV files into a pandas DataFrame
- Clean messy data with a wrangle function
- Create a machine learning pipeline with feature encoding and imputation
- Create insightful visualizations like a Mapbox scatter plot, a heatmap, and a bar chart for model coefficients

## Project 3

- Get data by querying a MongoDB database.
- Prepare time series data for analysis.
- Build an autoregression model.
- Improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.

## Project 4

- Get data by querying a SQL database.
- Build a logistic regression model for classification.
- Build a decision tree model for classification.
- Incorporate ethical considerations into your model building.

## Project 5

- Navigate a file system using the command line
- Load and save files using Python
- Work with imbalanced data using resampling
- Build ensemble models like random forest and gradient boosting trees
- Evaluate a classification model using precision and recall

## Project 6

- Conduct complex exploratory data analysis on one of the biggest datasets in the DS lab, and compare sub-populations using a side-by-side bar chart.
- Apply key concepts of unsupervised learning into practice by building an k-means model.
- Conduct feature selection for clustering based on variance.
- Reduce high-dimensional data using principal component analysis (PCA).
- Design, build and deploy a Dash web application.

## Project 7

- Build a choropleth map to show the distribution of ADSL students around the world.
- Create a custom Python class to implement ETL processes.
- Design an experiment and analyze the results using a chi-square test.
- Build an interactive web application that follows a three-tiered design pattern.

## Project 8 

- Get data from a web API by making HTTP requests.
- Transform and load data to a SQL database using custom Python classes.
- Calculate asset volatility and build a GARCH model to predict it.
- Build your own web API and server to serve your modelâ€™s predictions.
